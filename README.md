# Spotify Media Widget

A lightweight desktop widget for controlling Spotify playback with a modern, minimal UI and global hotkeys. This project is designed as a learning tool, allowing users to set up their own Spotify Developer account and customize the widget according to their needs.

## Important Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **Spotify Premium Required**: This widget requires a Spotify Premium account to control playback (play/pause, next/previous). This is a limitation of the Spotify Web API, not the widget itself.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Developer Account Required**: You need to create your own Spotify Developer account and set up your own application to use this widget. This is a learning project, and you should not use someone else's client ID.

- üîä System volume control (works with any account)
- üé® Modern, minimal UI with glassmorphism effect
- üíæ Persistent settings (window position, volume, hotkeys)
- üîÑ Automatic reconnection
- üöÄ Startup with Windows option
- üì¶ Build system included for creating installers

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/media-widget.git
   cd media-widget
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Core dependencies
   pip install PyQt5==5.15.9
   pip install spotipy==2.23.0
   pip install keyboard==0.13.5
   pip install psutil==5.9.5

   # Build dependencies (optional)
   pip install pyinstaller==6.1.0
   ```
   If the specified versions don't work, install simply like `pip install PyQt5`.
3. **Set Up Spotify Developer Account**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Log in with your Spotify account
   - Click "Create App"
   - Fill in the app details:
     - App name: "Media Widget"
     - App description: "Desktop widget for Spotify control"
     - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
   - After creating the app, you'll get a Client ID
   - Create a `spotify_credentials.json` file or you can rename the `spotify_credentials.json.template`:
     ```json
     {
         "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
         "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8888/callback"
     }
     ```
   - You can use my redirect URL as it has been deployed already:
      ```json
      {
         "redirect_url": "https://spotify-callback-omega.vercel.app/"
      }
      ```

4. **Run the Widget**
   ```bash
   python media_widget.py
   ```

## Building the Project
#### Make sure that you have created the `spotify_credentials.json` file as it is necessary for performing build

```

### Required Permissions

For the widget to control Spotify playback, ensure these permissions are enabled in your Spotify Developer Dashboard:

1. **For Users**
   - **Premium Account Required** for playback control features
   - Free accounts can still:
     - View currently playing tracks
     - Control system volume
     - Use the widget interface
   - Users must have Spotify Desktop app installed and running
   - Users must be logged into their Spotify account
   - Users must have an active device (Spotify Desktop app must be open in background)

## Troubleshooting Player Control

If the widget connects but can't control playback:

1. **Check Spotify Account Type**
   - Premium account is required for playback control
   - Free accounts will see "Premium Required" errors in logs
   - Free accounts can still view track information

2. **Check Spotify Desktop App**
   - Ensure Spotify Desktop app is running
   - Try restarting Spotify Desktop app
   - Make sure you're logged in to the correct account

3. **Check Permissions**
   - Disconnect from the widget
   - Clear the cache:
     - Delete `.spotify_cache` in `%APPDATA%\MediaWidget\`
   - Reconnect to Spotify
   - When the browser opens, ensure you accept ALL permissions

4. **Check Active Device**
   - Open Spotify Desktop app
   - Play any song
   - Check if the widget shows the current song
   - If not, try:
     - Pause/play in Spotify Desktop app
     - Switch to a different song
     - Restart Spotify Desktop app

5. **Common Issues**
   - If controls don't work:
     - Check if Spotify Desktop app is the active device
     - Try playing a song in Spotify Desktop app first
     - Ensure no other app is controlling Spotify
   - If song info doesn't update:
     - Check if Spotify Desktop app is playing
     - Try refreshing the widget
     - Check the log file for errors

6. **Hotkeys not working**
   - Check if the hotkeys conflict with other applications
   - Try resetting to default hotkeys
   - Ensure the widget is running

### Logging
- Logs are stored in `%APPDATA%\MediaWidget\media_widget.log`
- Check this file for detailed error messages
